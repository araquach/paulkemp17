<h3>Schwarzkopf Professional Elite Symposium</h3>
<p><strong>The PK team members often get the opportunity to go to hairdressing events that take place throughout the year. <em>Schwarzkopf</em> organises a few annual events and as they are one of our major suppliers we like to get involved.</strong></p>
<p>This year they organised a new one - the <strong>Schwarzkopf Professional Elite Symposium</strong> - a day of seminars, competitions, product launches complete with a sit down meal and party in the evening. We thought it would be good to get as many of the team going that we could.</p>
<p>We ran an incentive in the salon and 10 of the guys from across both salons won tickets to join the 300+ hairdressers invited to the event.</p>
<p>I asked PK stylist <strong>Ashley Tennant</strong> to write up her experience of the event&hellip;</p>

<p>Our day started with an early morning drive down to Birmingham where we arrived at the Belfry hotel at 11am to start our day at the all day hair event held by <em>Schwarzkopf</em>.</p>
<p>We were greeted by <em>Schwarzkopf</em> account managers who gave us information about the day’s events and we checked into the hotel. Whilst helping ourselves to the complimentary teas and coffee we got a chance to meet the other stylists who had come from all over the country to be at this Schwarzkopf event.</p>
<p>Whilst waiting to go into the first presentation at around 12am we were provided with a lunch buffet. </p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/symposium4.jpg', 'Steven McDowell') }}
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/symposium5.jpg', 'Osis') }}
<p>The show was hosted by Stephen McDowle who welcomed us to the event and started the day off with the '<strong>Osis: Made to Create</strong>' re-launch. Introducing 8 new “hero” products and the repackaging of the entire range they taught us all about these new products whilst using them to create upcoming trends.</p>
<p><strong>Undercoat </strong>- A primer for hair which creates a seamless look and feel, this revolutionary prepping product is one were all excited about.</p>
<p><strong>Big Blast </strong>- A light weight volumising gel used in a way that hasn’t been used before, blow drying the gel into damp hair to create moveable volume that isn’t crisp to the touch like gels we’ve known in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Curl Honey </strong>- A honey scented curl cream which when diffused into coarse curly hair creates the perfect natural curls, smooth and frizz free.</p>
<p><strong>Bouncy Curls </strong>- This oil based lightweight gel has strong curl definition. Blow dry in to damp hair to give a soft bounce to normal/fine curls.</p>
<p><strong>Tame Wild </strong>- A strong control smoothing cream which defies frizz and humidity for up to 7 days. Work in o damp hair and style as desired for soft touch, shiny and smooth hair.</p>
<p>As well as drying products, three new styling products were introduced for defining texture in an out of the box way:</p>
<p><strong>Play tough </strong>- An ultra strong waterproof gel which can be used on wet or dry hair.</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Matte </strong>- This strong control mattifying wax is perfect for a groomed yet rough look.</p>
<p><strong>Damped </strong>- Finally, a product that dries in to the hair but remains “wet-look”. Perfect for sleek, polished styles.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/symposium6.jpg', 'Essential Looks') }}
<p>After the product re-launch, the <em>Essential Looks</em> show started. Essential looks is Schwarzkopf’s predictions for the upcoming trends in the world of hair, picking ideas from fashion catwalks and matching it to the clothes and styles on the runways.</p>
<p><em>Essential Looks</em> is always something we look forward to as we take a lot from it and use it to inspire new ideas back at the salon.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/symposium7.jpg', 'Inspire UK') }}
<p>Once the Essential Looks finished, the <em>Inspire Live UK</em> competition entries took to the stage with their models. Each salon presented their creations and explained what they took from this year’s Essential Looks when creating their colour, cut and styles. It was exciting to watch and something we were all interested in taking part in next year.</p>
<p>We then checked in to our lavish hotel rooms and got ready for the night in black tie and cocktail dresses, everyone looked amazing! We were then seated back into the presentation hall where the <em>Inspire Live UK</em> competition winner was announced. The celebrations commenced with a three course meal and complimentary wine for the table before heading over to the hotels night club 'Bel Air' to party for the rest of the night.</p>

<p><strong>The whole day was great fun and very inspiring so thank you to Schwarzkopf and Jakarta/Pk management for giving us that opportunity! We can’t wait for next year!</strong></p>

<h3>Essential Looks Competition</h3>
<p><strong>A couple of weeks ago we had our 3rd in-salon ‘Essential Looks’ competition - stylists from the Jakata and PK teams paired up to create a look inspired by the latest Schwarzkopf collections. In the previous competitions the stylists carried out the looks on training heads. We thought we’d mix it up a bit this time and have members of the public as models for the teams!</strong></p>
<p>After a morning session running through the looks with Steve Ward (Schwarzkopf educator) the stylists paired off into 5 teams and came up with a look taking influence from the latest collections - plus choosing something that would suit their models lifestyle.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read more &gt;</p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<p>The looks had to be completed within a certain timescale after which each team presented their model and explained the techniques they had used and where they took their inspiration from.</p>
<h4>Leon (PK) &amp; Tash (PK)</h4>
<p>Leon &amp; Tash took their colour inspiration from the <strong>'Urban Sport'</strong> collection, using pre-lightened diamond shaped panels, they used a variety of the new <em>Schwarzkopf 'ColorWorx'</em> colours to create a bold, high impact look.</p>
<p>Their cut &amp; style was taken from the <strong>'FreeCreation'</strong> collection. A bold, structured fringe creates maximum impact. The look was styled and finished using <em>Schwarzkopf Osis 'Blow &amp; Go', 'Sparkler' and 'Elastic' finishing spray.</em></p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/leon_tash.jpg', 'Leon & Tash', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<h4>Nat (JAKATA) &amp; Ashley (PK)</h4>
<p>Nat &amp; Ashley sectioned the hair into panels under a veil and pre-lightened prior to applying <em>Schwarzkopf 'ColorWorx'</em>  teal fading into blue, and pink fading into purple. The colour was inspired by a look from the <strong>'Urban Sports'</strong> collection.</p>
<p>The cut and style was heavily influenced by the '<strong>Future Wave</strong>' trend. Triangular sections were taken to create a textured cut. A curling wand was used to create soft textured curls. <em>Schwarzkopf Osis 'Undercoat', 'Dust it' and 'Elastic'</em> were used to create the finished look.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/nat_ash.jpg', 'Nat & Ashley', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<h4>Kellie (PK) &amp; Maisie (JAKATA)</h4>
<p>Kellie &amp; Maisie took their colour inspiration from the <strong>'Urban Sports'</strong> collection. Using a diamond shaped sectioning pattern they created a purple ombre with the new <em>'ColorWorx'</em> colours.</p>
<p>Their cut and style was taken from the <strong>'FreeCreation'</strong> collection- a blunt, bold fringe sets the style off. The hair was styled smooth and shiny using <em>Osis 'Tame Wild' and 'Blow &amp; Go'.</em></p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/maisie_kel.jpg', 'Maisie & Kellie', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<h4>Caleb (PK) &amp; Laura (JAKATA)</h4>
<p>Caleb &amp; Laura were also heavily influenced by the <strong>'Urban Sports'</strong> collection. Laura used a graduating colour technique shifting colour from green to blue to purple with the <em>'ColorWorx'</em> palette.</p>
<p>Caleb's haircut was inspired from the <strong>'FreeCreation'</strong> collection - a bold undercut style, with the top dressed in an upward fashion with a wavy texture. <em>Schwarzkopf Osis 'Flex Wax', 'Dust It' and 'Session'</em> were applied to finish the striking look.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/caleb_laura.jpg', 'Caleb & Laura', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<h4>Shell (PK) &amp; Matt (JAKATA)</h4>
<p>Shell &amp; Matt pre-lightened their models hair prior to applying shades of blue and green from the <em>'ColorWorx'</em> range for their <strong>'Urban Sport'</strong> inspired colour.</p>
<p>The cut and style had influences from 2 different looks from within the <strong>'FreeCreation'</strong> collection. <em>Osis 'Blow &amp; Go', 'Upload', 'Dust It' and 'Mighty Matte'</em> were all used to style the hair.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/matt_shell.jpg', 'Matt & Shell', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<h4>The Final Looks</h4>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/groupshot_large.jpg', 'The Final Looks', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<h4>The Judging</h4>
<p>The Judges (Adam, Jimmi, Steve and Natalie) inspected each models hair style and awarded points on creativity, application, cutting &amp; styling skills and presentation skills.</p>
<p><strong>It was a tough call as all the models looked fantastic but the top 3 were chosen…</strong></p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/el/winners.jpg', 'The Winners', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<p><strong>1st Place: Laura &amp; Caleb</strong></p>
<p><strong>2nd Place: Matt &amp; Shell</strong></p>
<p><strong>3rd place: Kellie &amp; Maisie</strong></p>
<p>Laura said <em>"I was totally shocked that I won! I was pleased to win a free day's holiday too!"</em></p>
<p>Caleb added <em>"It was a huge confidence boost plus it was such a fantastic day - I can't wait for the next one in November!"</em></p>

<h3>Colour Masters</h3>
<p><strong>Last year was a big movement in our education department. Our focus was on putting our stylist through their paces. We have always had a strong focus on eduction and developing our team’s skill sets, but to further this we put all of our senior team members in both salons through a colour master class.</strong></p>
<p>The Schwarzkopf Professional Colour Master Class represents a gold standard in colour education with an innovative delivery method. The learning units are dedicated to all aspects of colour, from the philosophy of colour, interpretation, selection and application. The focus of this course is not only on theory of colour but also a practical hands-on experience.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read more &gt;</p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<p>Colour isn’t just a trend-led creative process, it’s a technical speciality which requires years of training and constant education to keep you ahead of the game and up to speed on trends, techniques and product updates. A fantastic colourist also needs to have an advanced understanding of the technical aspects of colour and the processes involved, including how best to implement those techniques for each individual client.</p>
<p>Izzy &amp; Kelly travelled to London on a regular basis throughout the year to train with Schwarzkopf’s National technical specialists. Completing a final exam at the end of the year all of our team passed with flying colours… no pun intended! Now qualified colour masters they have brought the education back to the rest of the team. We have really seen a massive step up in our teams colour knowledge.</p>
<p>Leon was recently promoted to Senior Stylist level and as part of his movement up the ranks he's completing the course over the next 12 months to bring him in line with the other senior team members.</p>
<p class="offerHeading">You can be always be confident in the knowledge that all the team here at Paul Kemp Hairdressing are trained to the highest levels in hairdressing.</p>

<section class="hidden">
<dl>
	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for Caleb?</dt>
	<dd>Five years (Including training)</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the PK team?</dt>
	<dd>The 8th of July 2015</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I was 19 and had just achieved my BTEC in photography when I realised that photography wasn’t the industry that I wanted to be in. So following my 20th birthday I applied for an apprenticeship in a local salon and never looked back.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>Interior design has always grasped my interests along with studio photography.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make PK good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>From what I’ve seen so far there is a very clear line of progression. Each stylists strengths and weaknesses are recognised and a plan is made to either train others in your strengths or have someone train you where your weaknesses lie.
	Internal competitions keeps everyone fresh and gives them a chance to show off what they are capable of too. Every season we have an 'Essential Looks' workshop where we work on the latest looks. The staff are so friendly and helpful, their skills aren’t their best kept secret which is great.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>I have a love for Pixie cuts at moment. The option to have a sleek, smooth, classy look or ruffle up for a textured, fun yet stylish finish is something that really appeals to me.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone’s hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Michael McIntyre. Would love to meet him and I think cutting his hair would be an experience in itself.</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you keep up with new ideas the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>Colleagues, friends and the use of social media and Internet. Occasionally the news when celebs come out with some crazy styles that begin to trend.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Listening to your clients criteria and needs. You have to remember that every person has a different opinion. What I might class as an amazing cut or style, my client may find repulsive. Also pushing the boundaries and being unique in your cutting/styling techniques</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Practise and don’t get frustrated if something doesn’t quite work out. No one will ever know everything there is about hair but you get out of it what you put in.</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>A client of mine was turning 40 had long straight virgin hair that reached half way down her back and had never been coloured.
	We took the length up to shoulder length and went all over vibrant copper with a full fringe and styled with messy curls.
	she was so happy she cried and gave me a massive hug.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets PK apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>The staff and the views and opinions of the staff. Everybody I have spoken to knows exactly what they are doing and are very relaxed when doing so. To quote Jimmy “we are professional but not robotic” and I think thats the key.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at PK?</dt>
	<dd>I would say the people I meet and the sense of satisfaction I get from my clients knowing I’ve been a part of making them feel confident, happy and good about themselves. Having access to the latest product innovations.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think is the most exciting new hair trend?</dt>
	<dd>Definitely white/grey/silver hair. Seeing more and more silver ombres too</dd>
	
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>TIGI bed head - the products do what they say, look good, funky, contemporary and smell amazing.</dd>
	
	<dt>What is your favourite product?</dt>
	<dd>Bed head after party. Smells great, adds amazing shine and fab for dressing out curls.</dd>
	
	<dt>Is there a certain time period or style icon you look to for inspiration?</dt>
	<dd>I love the 1940’s vintage style of hair up. I often try to re-create these styles from pictures on pinterest.</dd>
	
	<dt>Is there a celebrity that inspires you? who and why?</dt>
	<dd>Not specifically. I sometimes look at celebrities and take note on their hair, make up, outfits but never really seek out inspiration from them.</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you have a signature hairstyle? if so, describe it.</dt>
	<dd>Curly blow dries. I love the texture, curls, height and volume.</dd>
	
	<dt>What inspires you in the world of fashion, hair and beauty?</dt>
	<dd>Quirkiness. Anything a bit different and outside the box. Vicky from our sister salon JAKATA actually gives me inspiration every time I see her. Hair, outfits, tattoos. Love it</dd>
	
	<dt>What would you say are your strengths as a hairdresser?</dt>
	<dd>Colouring has always been a strong point and also a favourite. I love doing hair up but I still need more practice at it to perfect my techniques. Customer service skills are something I pride myself on too.</dd>

<h3>New faces at Paul Kemp Hairdressing</h3>
<p><strong>It’s been a while since we’ve had new stylists join the PK team, so we decided earlier in the year it was time to take on some new talent! We had an in depth recruitment drive which led to inviting a number of hairdressers in for trade tests to see what they had to offer. The test involved each applicant doing a cut &amp; colour to demonstrate their current skill sets.</strong></p>
<p>Out of all the applicants we had two that really impressed us. <em>Caleb Barrie and Leanne Bartlett</em> both demonstrated some great skills, each with different levels of experience. 
We offered them both positions and we’re excited to announce that they’ll be joining the team on July 8th!</p>

<h3>BC Fibre Force</h3>
<p>We've all been guilty of mistreating our hair from time to time, whether it's through over straightening, over colouring or just using poor quality products. Hair is tough, but you do have to treat it right if you want it to behave itself!</p>
<p>Schwarzkopf realised there are a lot of people out there not giving their hair the love and care it needs, so they introduced BC Fibre Force - a complete range of products designed to return your hair to it's former glory over a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>Here's what Schwarzkopf say:</p>
<p><em>BC Fibre Force introduces a new dimension of hair repair returning even most eroded hair to its optimal level of force and resilience.</em></p>
<p><em>For the first time the formulas with Micronized Hair-Identical Keratins penetrate deeply into the hair architecture to re-cement specifically the Cell-Membrane-Complex, the intercellular bonding cement responsible for strong and resilient hair fibre.</em></p>
<p>Which in English means that it's going to make the most damaged hair feel loads healthier!</p>
<p><strong>The complete range is as follows:</strong></p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/fibre_force_2.jpg', 'Fibre Force') }}
	<p>BC Fibre Force Shampoo</p>

<h3>Stylists Battle it out in Essential Looks Competition</h3>
<p><strong>Every season Schwarzkopf launch their Essential Looks collections, a set of styles influenced by future hair/fashion trends. Every time the new collections are launched we have an in—salon workshop run by a Schwarzkopf educator to keep everyone up to date with the latest looks.</strong></p>
<p>This time we thought we’d mix it up a bit and have an in-house competition. The session was held at our sister salon Jakata where we paired everyone off. Each pair of stylists had to create their own interpretation of a colour &amp; cut from the latest Essential Looks collections on a training head.</p>

<p>Jimmy said “It’s a brilliant way to get the staff on board with new cutting and colour trends, the Essential looks are always ahead of the game and are a great inspiration to the teams. The competition allows them to try out some new techniques”</p>
<p>The competition was judged by Adam, Jimmy and Steve from Schwarzkopf with bronze, silver and gold awards given out for the best interpretations of the styles.</p>
<p>The winners this time were Leon (from Paul Kemp Hairdressing) and Vikki (from Jakata) who did a bold bob inspired from the ‘Pearlescent Girls’ collection.</p>
<p>The session was great fun and we’ll have to see who the next winners will be when the next Essential Looks are launched!</p>

<dl>
	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for Ashley?</dt>
	<dd>Almost 2 years</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the PK team?</dt>
	<dd>I started at the salon in October 2013</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I realised I wanted to be a hairdresser during my year 9 work experience. I started at Paul Kemp hairdressing as an apprentice where I have since finished my training and now work as a fully qualified graduate stylist.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>As I studied English literature, Sociology and media in college I would have gone to uni to do journalism if I hadn’t chosen to do hairdressing.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Paul Kemp Hairdressing good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>All management and colleagues are fully supportive, with training courses readily available in places such as London &amp; Manchester</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>My current favourite style is the long messy bob as it looks on trend and is effortless to style.</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you keep up with new ideas the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>I keep up with latest trends by following celebrity news such as Daily Mail online as it is usually celebrities who are ‘wearing it first’ like Kylie Jenner's bob.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Regular cuts, in salon treatments and a good shampoo and conditioner such as Bed Heads 'Urban Antidotes'</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Be confident, watch other stylist as much as you can to pick up any tricks.</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>Cutting one clients hair from a style she was bored with to an edgy Agnes Deyn style pixie cut. She loved it and it looked almost identical to the picture she showed me which made me feel proud!</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets PK apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>Friendly staff, approachable managers. Reputable and fun to work in.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at PK?</dt>
	<dd>Being part of a team who are all real friends and get on out and inside of work.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think is the most exciting new spring summer 2015 hair trend?</dt>
	<dd>Schwarzkopf’s new ‘Pearlescense’ colour range excites me as I think this is a great way to spice up blonde hair. I also think the pastel colours are on trend this spring/summer.</dd>
	
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>Bed head is my favourite product range as I think they have clever packaging and everything smells amazing. Also guaranteed that all products actually do what they say.</dd>
	
	<dt>What is your favourite product?</dt>
	<dd>Small talk as I think this is a really nice blow drying product which makes hair appear thicker and smoother.</dd>
	
	<dt>Is there a celebrity that inspires you? Who and why?</dt>
	<dd>Blake Lively is a celebrity who inspires me as she has a very effortless style, her hair always looks amazing and boho-esque</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you have a signature hairstyle? if so, describe it.</dt>
	<dd>Messy, loose curl/waves</dd>
	
	<dt>What are your strengths in hairdressing?</dt>
	<dd>Colouring is my favourite thing to do at the moment but I can’t wait to start learning weft extensions as I enjoy plaiting hair and creating totally different styles.</dd>

<p>The designers involved are all lined up to be 'the next big thing' in the fashion industry. Some of the designers have already been recruited by top fashion brands, which were using the event to showcase their latest work.</p>

<h3>New BC Bonacure launch</h3>
<p><strong>Tailor Made Care for Ultimate Hair Perfection</strong></p>
<p>Schwarzkopf have always had a big part to play in the salon. Every colour service we do uses Schwarzkopf's amazing colour range and we've always used their hair care range. In recent years Tigi's products have become more widely used in the salon as the brand really connected with the team and clients alike - making Schwarzkopf's products seem a little dull and dated.</p>
<p>So we were all really excited to hear that the Schwarzkopf range was getting a much needed relaunch with the packaging getting a facelift and the products getting a complete  overhaul - introducing some amazing new technology.</p>

<p>The new range has now arrived in the salon and I've got to say that so far we're all really impressed. The packaging looks a lot fresher and modern (would look great in any bathroom) and after using a variety of the products on our clients the results have been great. The newly formulated products definitely have the edge and the range is now a lot more comprehensive.</p>
<p>Schwarzkopf claim the products outperform the market leaders and that they bring your hair closer than ever to natural perfection! If your looking for flawless smoothness, superior colour shine, ultimate body, excellent hydration, stunning rejuvenation, outstanding activation or unmatched replenishment then these could be the products for you!</p>

<h3>Ultimate Summer Blondes</h3>
<p><strong>With summer almost here we'll soon be inundated with requests for dark to lights or brighter lighter blondes. There's just something about summer that makes everyone want to go blonde!</strong></p>
<p>Before you get excited about the thought of those bright blonde locks, put a little time into thinking about the best steps to take to achieve the perfect result.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read more &gt;</p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/blonde_me3.jpg', 'Summer Blonde 2') }}
<p>The first thing you should think about is the preparation of your hair before the service followed by the end result you want and then then how you're going to maintain the colour afterwards.</p>
<p>For me the biggest importance comes from what you do in the two months in advance of having the in salon service. Ask yourself what really makes one blonde better than another blonde?</p>
<p>The answer is the products that are used on your hair before, during and after the blonde service.</p>
<p>If you have really thought it through you would have spoken to you stylist on your last visit and discussed what to do before you have the colours applied. My best advice is you cannot get enough moisture and protein in your hair before you go ahead with the service. Start with Professional products before you go blonde (if you haven’t already) and get the foundations into the hair before you go ahead with the colour service.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/repair-rescue.jpg', 'Repair Rescue') }}
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/moisture-kick.jpg', 'Moisture Kick') }}
<p>Ask advice from your stylist about the best products to use in the months building up to your blonde service. It's vital to load the hair with protein &amp; moisture to ensure the healthiest result. In most cases I would recommend crossing the Schwarzkopf BC Repair range and the Bc Moisture kick range. Your going to be investing a fair bit of money on your next colour and cut, if you want the best result then why not spend the extra £40 - £60 on a great shampoo, conditioner, treatment &amp; moisture balm. These products used correctly will last you 3x the amount of time those high street brands, and the outcome of your hair is far superior.</p>
<p>With these foundations in place, your choices of levels of blondes are far greater and you will maintain the fullness, condition and shine of your hair. If your hair is already damaged then look into going on a recovery regime with Schwarzkopf BC Fibre Force. This will bring your hair back from the dead and ready for blondes in up to 10 weeks (depending on how damaged it is of course).</p>
<p>When it comes to having the actual lightening service, we have the most technologically advanced products available to give you your summer look. Bleaching hair has always had a stigma of being really damaging to the hair, drying it out and causing it to snap  - not anymore! We have two salon products which combine to create a perfect blonde with minimal damage, both from the Schwarzkopf 'Blonde Me' range:</p>
<h4>Pre lift Kera Protector</h4>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/blonde_me_kera.jpg', 'Blonde Me Kera Protector') }}
<p>This is a revolutionary in-salon product that acts as a protective outer layer to your hair whilst allowing the bleaching products in to do their job whilst preventing all the swelling and cuticle damage that normally comes with a bleaching service. By having this applied you really do maintain healthy hair qualities - meaning less damage and more shine. This pre bleaching treatment does come with an additional charge of £5-£10, but it's a no brainer if it's going to keep your hair in fantastic condition.</p>
<h4>Blonde me Crystal bleach</h4>
{{ Html::image('images/news_images/blonde_me_crystal.jpg', 'Blonde Me Crystal Bleach') }}
<p>This state of the art bleaching agent is miles ahead of other bleaching products on the market. It's clear in colour so the stylist can really see how your hair is lifting. It's so soft on your hair you will notice the difference immediately, leaving minimal damage  and maximum moisture left in the hair. I find when I use it, it actually leaves the hair feeling better than before! If you want platinum white blonde then dependant on the lift needed this product may not be for you (we have another 'Blonde Me' bleach that lifts 9 levels with minimum damage!) but any other blondes and you will not be left disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>The main things to take from this are:</strong></p>

	<p>- Use quality professional product's in the run up to the service.</p>
	<p>- Ensure the highest quality salon products are used during the service</p>
	<p>- Maintain the health and condition of your hair by continuing to use the products recommended by your stylist.</p>

<p>Salon owner Adam Carter said "It's business as usual at PK - the team are stronger than ever. <br> We can't apologise enough for Paul's quick departure and any inconvenience it may have caused to his clients but our other stylists are on hand to ensure a smooth transition."</p>
<p>Many people are asking the question of whether the salon name will remain. A full rebrand is both costly and time consuming so the name will stay for a good while longer but will inevitably change in the future.</p>

<h3>Welcoming Michelle Railton to the team</h3>
<p><strong>It's been over 2 years now since we opened the doors to Paul Kemp Hairdressing and the team has progressively gone from strength to strength. We thought it was about time we brought some new blood on board, and when stylist <em>Michelle Railton</em> showed interest in joining us, we knew she would be the perfect fit.</strong></p>
<p>Michelle, aged 25, has almost ten years experience as a hairdresser and after taking a short break from it, realised there was no other career for her (plus no other salon she wanted to work for than here at PK!)</p>
<p>We had the chance to ask Michelle some questions about why she chose to work at Paul Kemp hairdressing, and what drives her as a hair stylist.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read the full interview here ></p>

<section class="hidden">
<dl>
	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for Michelle?</dt>
	<dd>I started hairdressing 9 years ago.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I have always wanted to be a hairstylist. At the age of 14 I started to work Saturdays in a local salon, where I later began an apprenticeship when I left school.</dd>
	
	<dt>Why did you choose to join Paul Kemp hairdressing?</dt>
	<dd>The salon has a very good reputation from both clients and staff. I had my hair coloured in the salon by Leon and I really liked the atmosphere. The stylists seem to get on really well with each other which I think is important.
	I also believe that there is a lot of opportunities to progress your career in the company.</dd>
	{{ Html::image('images/news_images/michelle_r_2.jpg', '') }}
	
	<dt>When did you decide you wanted to join the Paul Kemp team?</dt>
	<dd>After I left Daniel Anderson hairdressing, I was drawn to join the Paul Kemp team but I decided to give running my own salon a go,  which I did for a year. Since I finished that in January, I took time out of hairdressing to decide what I  wanted to do. There was only one salon that I really wanted to work at in Warrington - that was Paul Kemp hairdressing!</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>After taking time out of hairdressing, I pursued a career in recruitment.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>Classic graduated bob, because you can take a classic style, and create many variations and changes to accommodate a clients requirements. I believe it is a timeless hairstyle that can suit all types of clients.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Sienna Miller because she has the perfect face shape/features to create any style. There would be no limitations or factors that would determine a certain hairstyle. She always has softer cut/finish and I would love to create something much bolder with harder lines and dramatic finish.</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you go about creating your cutting/colour styles? Is it difficult to think up new ideas and keep up with the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>I always have a consultation with every client. I ask them a series of questions which help me to identify their needs and what options of styles I could create. e.g:
	<ul class="list">
		<li>- Are you happy with your hair at the minute?</li>
		<li>- What do you hate about your hair?</li>
		<li>- What is the worst thing that I could do to your hair today?</li>
		<li>- If you could have any celebrities hair, who's would it be?</li>
	</ul>
	
	This helps me to understand their likes/dislikes along with their tastes in styles. I can then give my options on styles/colours. I sometimes combine a number of styles into one (if they like a certain fringe but like layers from another style etc). I always suggest a change to clients, so they don't get bored. I think if you are really into hairdressing, you will always be researching trends, which is what I enjoy.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Fully understanding a clients requirements.</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul class="list">
	<li>- Build a good trust with your clients. If they trust you, they will never leave you.</li>
	<li>- Always be honest with a client, they appreciate it more.</li>
	<li>- Always offer existing clients a 'change' at least every 3 months. They will not get bored and go elsewhere.</li>
	<li>- Always look at other stylist work. You will always learn new things.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	{{ Html::image('images/news_images/michelle_r_3.jpg', '') }}
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>One of my regular and loyal  customer would always require the same colour/style and was very reluctant to change. She had a natural tone of auburn with a base 6, which she would cover with a full head of bleach and ash toner. Although the colour suited her, it was far too harsh for her natural skin tone and the years of bleaching was affecting the condition of her hair.<br>
	Over the years, I had built up a good trust and I finally persuaded her to have a change. She was very nervous as I suggested taking her back to a base 6 with a vibrant copper tone, shortening the length to the shoulders and creating a soft, middle-parted fringe. 
	After colouring/toning the hair, I then cut and styled it, without allowing her to look in the mirror throughout the process. <br>When she finally saw herself with the new colour and style, she began to cry as she loved the change and was very pleased with the finished look. This gave me the most  satisfaction because although she did not really want the change, she trusted me enough and my judgment, which she was pleased with in the end.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Paul Kemp Hairdressing apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>The respect that the staff have for their employers, It always seems a fun/enjoyable place to work and the stylists seem to really get on with one another which I think is really important when you are part of a team, as not many salons have that. The salon seems to always be encouraging staff to enter competitions which I think is really good. Clients know when there is a good atmosphere and that is the reason they go back to a salon.</dd>
	
	<dt>What are you looking forward to most when starting at PK?</dt>
	<dd>Building my client base, being part of a vibrant team again and learning new techniques/ideas from other stylists.</dd>
		
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>Tigi Bed Head. I use this myself at home, I think each product does exactly what it says, the value for money is good and there is a wide variety for hair types/styles.</dd>
	
	<dt>Is there a celebrity that inspires you? Who and why?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, Sienna Miller. She is a trend setter. She makes the effort to  keep in with latest trend but puts her own mark on them. She will alternate styles from glamorous to boho. She has her own signature look although she will try new looks.</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you have a signature hairstyle? If so, describe it.</dt>
	<dd>When doing gents, I have always enjoyed the 'indie style' haircuts. From having an interest in Indie music and the indie scene, I have always been keen to keep up with the latest trend. The cut that I would say was my  signature style would be the Paul Weller/Liam Gallagher mullet with a short cropped fringe, longer sideburns with heavily texturised layers on the crown. This is the cut that I enjoy the most and love doing.</dd>
	{{ Html::image('images/news_images/michelle_r_4.jpg', '') }}
	
	<dt>What pushes your buttons in the world of fashion,  hair and beauty?</dt>
	<dd>I like new and quirky. If I see something original, that hasn't been done before, then I want to know everything about it and how to create it. I love learning new things and I am interested in ideas that have been thought of outside the box.</dd>
